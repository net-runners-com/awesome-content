## Selected blueprint: grid-card-assemble

# grid-card-assemble — Grid / Card Assemble

**intent**: N items (tiles / cards / logos / list-lines) self-assemble in a staggered cascade into a grid or vertical list and hold — a "look how much / who / what it does" beat that enumerates breadth at once; an optional camera zoom-OUT pulls back to reveal the assembled array sitting inside a vaster whole.

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from key-feature-card-grid-assemble): a grid of labeled feature tiles/pills (icon + label) cascades one-by-one into a 2-col-brick / 3×3 grid, then holds near-static with a slow push-in — enumerate many capabilities, no live UI, no cursor.
- Key_Feature (from key-feature-glass-card-camera-reveal): open TIGHT on 2–3 glowing icons; a camera zoom-OUT unfolds a row of glassmorphism cards that grow from behind the icons (icons shrink to card headers), center card scales forward, the group floats, then sweeps out — a "pillars revealed at once" reveal variant of the same assemble shape.
- Benefits (from benefits-vertical-list): short value phrases populate a single vertical list ~1 item/sec, co-resident and accumulating; each line enters via a spring marker-pop + check-draw + pill mask-wipe, OR the whole stack snaps up one slot per beat (slot-machine) so the newest lands in the bright focal slot.
- Social_Proof (from social-proof-logo-grid-zoom-out): a wall of partner/app logos builds into a center grid (whole-enter / randomized pop-in / column slide-up), an optional headline + accent-gradient proof-number fills in above, then a continuous camera zoom-OUT shrinks the array to reveal a vast ecosystem; optional fixed HUD/viewfinder brackets; optional grid slide-up fly-out exit.
- Key_Feature (from live-data-populate-board): the array assembles by POPULATING ITSELF — skeleton pills fill and swap to real data, cards spring in tethered to map markers — and its state keeps flipping live after assembly (status pills stepping through states); no cursor, locked frame. The "look how much" beat becomes "look, it's doing it right now."
- Benefits (from item-field-to-payoff-card): a breadth FIELD — a rapidly streaming list past a fixed focal slot, or a chip array with one highlighted hero — plays its breadth motion, then CLEARS to concise centered payoff text (claim / price / URL end card). The array is the argument's setup; the payoff line is its landing.

**duration**: 3.0–10.5s (Social_Proof 3.0–6s · live-populate 4.2–7.8s · Key_Feature grid 5.8–7.3s · Benefits stream/field-to-payoff 5.9–8.4s · Key_Feature glass-card 6.5s · Benefits list 6.5–10.5s, scaling ~1 item/sec with count)

**shot structure** (consolidated template — concrete motion verbs, [slots])

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.0s) — open + first arrivals.** On a `[gradient / radial / dark background]` (optional `[dot-grid / drifting-watermark]` texture), an empty `[grid or list region]` is established and items begin to ASSEMBLE in a quick staggered cascade (~0.04–0.08s gap; list pacing ~1 item/sec). Each `[item: feature tile / pill / logo tile / benefit line]` fades + slides/scales a short distance directly into its slot (low drama — no scatter, no big bounce; spring overshoot reserved for accent markers). Camera static. An opening `[headline / hook]` may fill in line-by-line above the array, with any `[proof number]` counting up in an `[accent gradient]`.
- **Scene 2 (~1.0s–~Xs) — array resolves + holds.** Remaining items finish arriving; layout resolves into the final `[2-col-brick / 3×3 grid / dense mosaic / stacked list]`. The completed array HOLDS, alive but resting: a gentle continuous parallax/sine FLOAT on the tiles and/or a slow camera push-in (faint scale-up). Optional `[accent-color]` glow TRAVELS across/behind the tiles.
- **Scene 3 (~Xs–end) — settle / reveal / exit.** Everything settles and holds to the end, OR the optional camera modifier runs (see below), OR a `[closing line / CTA]` book-ends the array. OR the field CLEARS to payoff copy — the array exits and a concise centered `[claim / price / URL]` lands (price via a very fast character snap-build with a split-second partial state; URL via a left-to-right reveal, holding in `[accent]` and flipping to `[ink]` only in the final beat) — OR the camera PUSHES THROUGH one highlighted `[hero item]` (single rapid accelerating push-in) and crossfades into a second, vaster receding `[word-grid depth field]` that continuously scales down to reveal ever more items before fading to the payoff.

Variants (where roles diverge from the template):

- **Variant — Key_Feature grid**: items are labeled `[icon + feature-label]` tiles/pills assembling into a 2-col-brick / 3×3 grid; near-static hold with slow push-in + optional traveling-glow sweep; headline book-ends (`[hook]` → `[CTA]`). No camera reveal.
- **Variant — Key_Feature glass-card-reveal**: the assemble is CAMERA-DRIVEN, not element-stagger. Open tight on `[2–3 glowing icons]`; camera zoom-OUT grows `[N]` glass cards out from behind the icons (icons shrink ~50% to become card headers), `[center card]` scales ~105% and moves forward to overlap the sides (quick spring); cards hold side-by-side with continuous parallax float; exit = fast motion-blur SWEEP slides the cards off-frame.
- **Variant — Benefits vertical-list**: a single vertical `[benefit-line]` stack, ~1 item/sec, three sub-modes — (a) BUILD: each line stays fully lit; entry = `[marker]` spring-pop + `[check/icon]` draw-in + `[pill]` mask-wipe of the text; (b) SNAP: the whole stack steps up one slot per beat (~0.1s eased) so the newest line lands in the bright focal slot and lines leaving it dim by position; (c) STREAM: the list scrolls rapidly and continuously past the focal slot — center item opaque `[ink]` and slightly enlarged, neighbors faded/shrunk — then DECELERATES to stop on the `[chosen item]`; optionally split-framed against a fixed static `[label]` on the opposite side; the field then clears to a centered `[payoff line]`. Static camera; optional perpetual `[decorative orbit/disc]` on the opposite side. No camera reveal.
- **Variant — Key_Feature live-populate**: the assemble is a DATA-POPULATION wave, cursorless, frame locked (± one gentle opening zoom-out that makes room for the `[headline]`). Two board shapes — (a) ANCHORED: `[white data cards]` spring in one-by-one, each tethered by a thin line to its `[marker]` on a `[map/board surface]` whose markers pulse (expanding fading rings); (b) TABULAR: new `[columns]` appear as grey skeleton pills, progress fills run left→right staggered top-to-bottom (colored fill with a leading tip), each bar SWAPPING to its real `[value/avatar chip]` on completion. After assembly the array stays LIVE: `[status pills]` flip states in quick snappy swaps (color-coded, several in succession), or the `[headline]` crossfades and a second population wave runs on a newly revealed region — the table content scrolling horizontally beneath a sticky first column to expose it. Hold lands on the fully populated, fully updated final state.
- **Variant — Social_Proof logo-wall-zoom-out**: intro beat (`[trusted-by headline]` card OR a `[product screenshot]`) crossfades/cuts to a center logo grid that builds (whole-enter / randomized pop-in / column slide-up); a continuous camera zoom-OUT then shrinks the whole grid toward center to reveal a vast ecosystem and holds; optional fixed HUD/viewfinder brackets; optional exit = whole grid SLIDES UP and flies out through the top.

**rule mapping** (motion verb → `rule-id`)

- item stagger-assemble into slot → `center-outward-expansion` (per-item stagger + short-path slide variant; for a wall too dense for a true center burst, use it in its "starting partially-spread"/direct-into-slot form — see merge tension)
- brick/grid/list layout resolve → `center-outward-expansion` (target positions = final layout slots)
- randomized pop-in stagger → `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe; randomized `from`/order)
- column slide-up into grid → `gsap-effects` (per-column staggered slide-up)
- vertical-list step / slot-machine snap-and-hold → `vertical-spring-ticker` (STEPS = number of line advances)
- spring-overshoot marker pop → `spring-pop-entrance` (back.out spring) — also `gsap-effects` for the staggered pop chain
- check / icon draw-in inside marker → `svg-path-draw`
- live line-art icon in a tile (internal parts) → `svg-icon-enrichment`
- pill / label mask-wipe text reveal → `techniques.md` (clip-path reveal)
- dim-by-position de-emphasis → `gsap-effects` (per-line opacity by slot position; no dedicated rule)
- line-by-line headline fill → `discrete-text-sequence`
- accent-gradient proof number count-up → `counting-dynamic-scale`
- gentle parallax / sine float on hold → `sine-wave-loop` (apply the concurrent-elements amplitude `/√N` rule for a held grid)
- slow camera push-in → `multi-phase-camera` (steady-push phase pattern)
- center-card scale-up + forward overlap → `spring-pop-entrance` (the quick spring) + `techniques.md` CSS-3D (z-depth overlap)
- cards-grow-from-behind-icons / icon-shrink-to-header → driven by the camera reveal (`multi-phase-camera`) — the grow/shrink are scale tweens chorded to the pull-back phase; no separate rule
- fixed HUD / viewfinder brackets → `ai-tracking-box` (static-bracket variant — overlay frame, not tracking)
- book-end headline fade → `discrete-text-sequence` (or `gsap-effects` fade)
- perpetual decorative orbit / disc / loop → `sine-wave-loop` (or `orbit-3d-entry` if it's an orbiting badge ring)
- traveling-glow sweep across/behind tiles → `ambient-glow-bloom` (one-pass traveling glow sweep across the tiles)
- motion-blur slide-out sweep (glass-card exit) → `motion-blur-streak` (directional velocity blur on the fast sweep that carries the cards off-frame)
- grid slide-up fly-out exit → `gsap-effects` (plain staggered translate-off-frame; no dedicated rule needed — a basic exit tween, not a missing capability)
- skeleton-pill progress fill → `stat-bars-and-fills` (progress-fill `scaleX` form; the leading tip is a chorded child element)
- fill-completes-swap-to-real-data / live status-pill flips / headline crossfade between waves → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-state replacement at time thresholds — the pill's states are text states)
- staggered top-to-bottom fill cascade → `gsap-effects` (per-row stagger on the fill tweens)
- tethered-card spring-in → `spring-pop-entrance` (the card) + `avatar-cloud-network` (the thin connection-line-to-anchor layout; anchor coordinates must match the marker exactly) + `svg-path-draw` if the tether draws in
- pulsing marker rings → `cursor-click-ripple` (its expanding-ring + attack-decay opacity envelope, minus the cursor/click, on a bounded repeat)
- sticky-column internal horizontal scroll → `viewport-change` (PAN form on the inner column layer; the sticky column sits outside the panned layer) — mark the moving layer `data-layout-allow-overflow` and clip at the table card
- rapid vertical stream past a focal slot + deceleration stop → `vertical-spring-ticker` (continuous form: one long decelerating translate instead of its stepped tweens; focal-slot emphasis reuses the dim-by-position mapping above)
- pill-widens-as-label-fills → `card-morph-anchor`'s substitution law (uniform `scaleX`/clip-path — never tween `width`) + `discrete-text-sequence` for the label fill
- push-through-the-hero-item exit → `multi-phase-camera` (single accelerating push phase) aimed via `coordinate-target-zoom` at the highlighted chip, crossfading at peak
- receding word-grid depth field → `viewport-change` (one `.world` wrapper, `cam.scale` ↓ continuously — the zoom-OUT reveal grammar pointed at a word field; size/opacity tiers fake the depth)
- price snap-build (split-second partial state) → `discrete-text-sequence` (non-linear typing with bulk additions — exactly its typo/partial-state mechanic)
- left-to-right URL reveal → `techniques.md` (clip-path reveal — same mapping as the pill mask-wipe); the final-beat color flip → `gsap-effects` (a `tl.set` at the beat — basic, no rule needed)

**camera modifier — zoom-OUT reveal** (optional; the role-defining move for the glass-card and logo-wall variants): a camera wrapper around the whole array scales DOWN over the hold, revealing the assembled grid/cards sitting inside a larger environment (ecosystem scale, or a row of cards unfolding from tight icons).

- Continuous single-pass zoom-out (Social_Proof ecosystem pull-back) → `viewport-change` (one wrapper, `cam.scale` ↓ via onUpdate — single source of truth)
- Phased pull-back → focus → settle, with built-in drift (Key_Feature tight-icons → cards-unfold) → `multi-phase-camera` (use the "Dramatic reveal: push → neutral → pull" / pull-back phase pattern; grow/shrink of cards chords to the pull-back phase)

---

```
BLUEPRINT: grid-card-assemble — serves Key_Feature, Benefits, Social_Proof (folded 4 drafts + 2 mined clusters: live-data-populate-board, item-field-to-payoff-card)
RULE COVERAGE: complete, no gaps — traveling-glow sweep → ambient-glow-bloom; motion-blur slide-out sweep (exit) → motion-blur-streak; grid slide-up fly-out (exit) → gsap-effects (plain translate); skeleton-fill populate → stat-bars-and-fills + discrete-text-sequence; push-through-hero exit → multi-phase-camera + coordinate-target-zoom
```

Merge tension: `center-outward-expansion` (the natural backing for stagger-assemble) caps cleanly at 3–8 items and explicitly warns 8+ causes mid-flight overlap chaos — but a Social_Proof logo wall is deliberately dense (12+ tiles), so for that variant the items must NOT burst from a shared center; they slide a short distance directly into their own slot (the rule's "starting partially-spread"/short-path form, or a `gsap-effects` per-item stagger), which the consolidated Scene-1 verb already specifies as "short distance directly into its slot."

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

# Spring-Pop Entrance

> **Smooth beats bouncy.** This entrance defaults to a smooth long-tail settle — `power3.out` (or `expo.out` for a faster front) — that decelerates cleanly into the resting size with **no overshoot**. Bouncy `back.out` is the **#1 instant turn-off** in agent-made videos and is almost never executed well; it is a rare, explicitly-playful exception (consumer / fun brand), never the default. When unsure, settle smoothly.

THE entrance primitive: an element (or staggered group) arrives by springing from nothing — `scale: 0 → 1`, optional small `y` rise — and settles without bouncing. This is **arrival**, not reaction: distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (a click/press → release feedback chain on an element that already rests on screen). Many blueprints used to borrow that rule to fake an entrance; reach for this instead.

## How It Works

One `fromTo` carries the whole arrival: from `{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }` (explicit, so t=0 is correct under seek) to `{ scale: 1, opacity: 1, ease: "power3.out" }`. For a **group**, the same `fromTo` runs per element at `i * STAGGER`, capped so the group reads as one arriving beat. The `scale` grow is load-bearing; the `y` rise is garnish — drop everything else and it must still read as a clean entrance. Let the ease produce the settle: never hand-key a `scale: 1.1` mid-state (it double-bounces against the curve).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="pop-hero" id="hero">{heroLabel}</div>

<div class="pop-grid">
  <div class="pop-item">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.pop-hero,
.pop-item {
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* in-place pop; move to the source point for the anchored variation */
  will-change: transform;
}
.pop-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: GRID_GAP;
  place-items: center;
}
```

```js
// Single hero pop — smooth long-tail settle, no overshoot.
tl.fromTo(
  "#hero",
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  ENTRY_AT,
);

// Staggered group pop — one arriving beat.
gsap.utils.toArray(".pop-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { scale: 0, opacity: 0, y: Y_RISE },
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
    GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Calm settle** (premium / enterprise): `power3.out`, no rotation, `Y_RISE` 0–12px — a weighted, confident landing for a hero wordmark or product shot.
- **Firm settle** (everyday default): `power3.out` or `expo.out` for a punchier front, `Y_RISE` ~24px — cards, icons, callouts.
- **Exact-physics settle**: when the settle IS the shot, swap the ease for `springEase({ response: 0.4 })` (critically damped) from `../adapters/gsap-easing-and-stagger.md` → Spring Eases; take `duration` from the helper.
- **Origin-anchored pop**: a callout growing out of a specific point (marker, pointer tip) sets `transform-origin` to that point (e.g. `0% 100%`) so `scale: 0 → 1` reads as "emerging from the source", not "inflating in place".
- **Pop into a held slot**: land the pop and hold still — no idle loop baked into the entrance. If the held frame genuinely needs life, hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for subtle jitter on a separate later tween; prefer revealing the next element on its VO cue.
- **Bouncy pop (RARE — explicitly-playful only)**: swap the ease for `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` and optionally settle a small `rotation: ROT_FROM → 0` so elements look hand-placed. Only for a deliberately playful register — never product / enterprise / serious tone:

```js
tl.fromTo(
  el,
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0, rotation: ROT_FROM },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, rotation: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: `back.out(${OVERSHOOT})` },
  GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
);
```

Even here keep `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2` — past that it reads as cartoon wobble. Better still: the baked spring at `dampingFraction: 0.6–0.7` (same adapters doc) gives ~5–10% overshoot that reads physical where `back.out` reads cartoon.

| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |

| ITEM_COUNT | 3–9                                       | >9 makes the stagger vanish — switch to a wipe/sweep reveal      |
| Y_RISE     | 0–32px                                    | small; never large enough to read as a slide-up                  |
| ROT_FROM   | −10°–+10°                                 | playful variant only; alternate sign by index (`i % 2 ? 6 : -6`) |
| ENTRY_AT   | 0–0.4s                                    | a beat of quiet, but keep the subject landing by t ≤ 0.5s        |

## Critical Constraints

- Default ease `power3.out` (no overshoot); `back.out` only in the explicitly-playful variant, and there `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2`.
- `ITEM_COUNT × STAGGER ≤ ~0.5s` — the group must land inside one beat.
- Entrances state the collapsed from-state in `fromTo` — never rely on a CSS-hidden start (it renders visible before the tween claims it under seek).
- `transform-origin: 50% 50%` for an in-place pop; the source point only for the anchored variation.
- This is a finite arrival — idle motion on a held element is a separate, later `sine-wave-loop` tween.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
