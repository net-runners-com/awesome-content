## Selected blueprint: grid-card-assemble

# grid-card-assemble — Grid / Card Assemble

**intent**: N items (tiles / cards / logos / list-lines) self-assemble in a staggered cascade into a grid or vertical list and hold — a "look how much / who / what it does" beat that enumerates breadth at once; an optional camera zoom-OUT pulls back to reveal the assembled array sitting inside a vaster whole.

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from key-feature-card-grid-assemble): a grid of labeled feature tiles/pills (icon + label) cascades one-by-one into a 2-col-brick / 3×3 grid, then holds near-static with a slow push-in — enumerate many capabilities, no live UI, no cursor.
- Key_Feature (from key-feature-glass-card-camera-reveal): open TIGHT on 2–3 glowing icons; a camera zoom-OUT unfolds a row of glassmorphism cards that grow from behind the icons (icons shrink to card headers), center card scales forward, the group floats, then sweeps out — a "pillars revealed at once" reveal variant of the same assemble shape.
- Benefits (from benefits-vertical-list): short value phrases populate a single vertical list ~1 item/sec, co-resident and accumulating; each line enters via a spring marker-pop + check-draw + pill mask-wipe, OR the whole stack snaps up one slot per beat (slot-machine) so the newest lands in the bright focal slot.
- Social_Proof (from social-proof-logo-grid-zoom-out): a wall of partner/app logos builds into a center grid (whole-enter / randomized pop-in / column slide-up), an optional headline + accent-gradient proof-number fills in above, then a continuous camera zoom-OUT shrinks the array to reveal a vast ecosystem; optional fixed HUD/viewfinder brackets; optional grid slide-up fly-out exit.
- Key_Feature (from live-data-populate-board): the array assembles by POPULATING ITSELF — skeleton pills fill and swap to real data, cards spring in tethered to map markers — and its state keeps flipping live after assembly (status pills stepping through states); no cursor, locked frame. The "look how much" beat becomes "look, it's doing it right now."
- Benefits (from item-field-to-payoff-card): a breadth FIELD — a rapidly streaming list past a fixed focal slot, or a chip array with one highlighted hero — plays its breadth motion, then CLEARS to concise centered payoff text (claim / price / URL end card). The array is the argument's setup; the payoff line is its landing.

**duration**: 3.0–10.5s (Social_Proof 3.0–6s · live-populate 4.2–7.8s · Key_Feature grid 5.8–7.3s · Benefits stream/field-to-payoff 5.9–8.4s · Key_Feature glass-card 6.5s · Benefits list 6.5–10.5s, scaling ~1 item/sec with count)

**shot structure** (consolidated template — concrete motion verbs, [slots])

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.0s) — open + first arrivals.** On a `[gradient / radial / dark background]` (optional `[dot-grid / drifting-watermark]` texture), an empty `[grid or list region]` is established and items begin to ASSEMBLE in a quick staggered cascade (~0.04–0.08s gap; list pacing ~1 item/sec). Each `[item: feature tile / pill / logo tile / benefit line]` fades + slides/scales a short distance directly into its slot (low drama — no scatter, no big bounce; spring overshoot reserved for accent markers). Camera static. An opening `[headline / hook]` may fill in line-by-line above the array, with any `[proof number]` counting up in an `[accent gradient]`.
- **Scene 2 (~1.0s–~Xs) — array resolves + holds.** Remaining items finish arriving; layout resolves into the final `[2-col-brick / 3×3 grid / dense mosaic / stacked list]`. The completed array HOLDS, alive but resting: a gentle continuous parallax/sine FLOAT on the tiles and/or a slow camera push-in (faint scale-up). Optional `[accent-color]` glow TRAVELS across/behind the tiles.
- **Scene 3 (~Xs–end) — settle / reveal / exit.** Everything settles and holds to the end, OR the optional camera modifier runs (see below), OR a `[closing line / CTA]` book-ends the array. OR the field CLEARS to payoff copy — the array exits and a concise centered `[claim / price / URL]` lands (price via a very fast character snap-build with a split-second partial state; URL via a left-to-right reveal, holding in `[accent]` and flipping to `[ink]` only in the final beat) — OR the camera PUSHES THROUGH one highlighted `[hero item]` (single rapid accelerating push-in) and crossfades into a second, vaster receding `[word-grid depth field]` that continuously scales down to reveal ever more items before fading to the payoff.

Variants (where roles diverge from the template):

- **Variant — Key_Feature grid**: items are labeled `[icon + feature-label]` tiles/pills assembling into a 2-col-brick / 3×3 grid; near-static hold with slow push-in + optional traveling-glow sweep; headline book-ends (`[hook]` → `[CTA]`). No camera reveal.
- **Variant — Key_Feature glass-card-reveal**: the assemble is CAMERA-DRIVEN, not element-stagger. Open tight on `[2–3 glowing icons]`; camera zoom-OUT grows `[N]` glass cards out from behind the icons (icons shrink ~50% to become card headers), `[center card]` scales ~105% and moves forward to overlap the sides (quick spring); cards hold side-by-side with continuous parallax float; exit = fast motion-blur SWEEP slides the cards off-frame.
- **Variant — Benefits vertical-list**: a single vertical `[benefit-line]` stack, ~1 item/sec, three sub-modes — (a) BUILD: each line stays fully lit; entry = `[marker]` spring-pop + `[check/icon]` draw-in + `[pill]` mask-wipe of the text; (b) SNAP: the whole stack steps up one slot per beat (~0.1s eased) so the newest line lands in the bright focal slot and lines leaving it dim by position; (c) STREAM: the list scrolls rapidly and continuously past the focal slot — center item opaque `[ink]` and slightly enlarged, neighbors faded/shrunk — then DECELERATES to stop on the `[chosen item]`; optionally split-framed against a fixed static `[label]` on the opposite side; the field then clears to a centered `[payoff line]`. Static camera; optional perpetual `[decorative orbit/disc]` on the opposite side. No camera reveal.
- **Variant — Key_Feature live-populate**: the assemble is a DATA-POPULATION wave, cursorless, frame locked (± one gentle opening zoom-out that makes room for the `[headline]`). Two board shapes — (a) ANCHORED: `[white data cards]` spring in one-by-one, each tethered by a thin line to its `[marker]` on a `[map/board surface]` whose markers pulse (expanding fading rings); (b) TABULAR: new `[columns]` appear as grey skeleton pills, progress fills run left→right staggered top-to-bottom (colored fill with a leading tip), each bar SWAPPING to its real `[value/avatar chip]` on completion. After assembly the array stays LIVE: `[status pills]` flip states in quick snappy swaps (color-coded, several in succession), or the `[headline]` crossfades and a second population wave runs on a newly revealed region — the table content scrolling horizontally beneath a sticky first column to expose it. Hold lands on the fully populated, fully updated final state.
- **Variant — Social_Proof logo-wall-zoom-out**: intro beat (`[trusted-by headline]` card OR a `[product screenshot]`) crossfades/cuts to a center logo grid that builds (whole-enter / randomized pop-in / column slide-up); a continuous camera zoom-OUT then shrinks the whole grid toward center to reveal a vast ecosystem and holds; optional fixed HUD/viewfinder brackets; optional exit = whole grid SLIDES UP and flies out through the top.

**rule mapping** (motion verb → `rule-id`)

- item stagger-assemble into slot → `center-outward-expansion` (per-item stagger + short-path slide variant; for a wall too dense for a true center burst, use it in its "starting partially-spread"/direct-into-slot form — see merge tension)
- brick/grid/list layout resolve → `center-outward-expansion` (target positions = final layout slots)
- randomized pop-in stagger → `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe; randomized `from`/order)
- column slide-up into grid → `gsap-effects` (per-column staggered slide-up)
- vertical-list step / slot-machine snap-and-hold → `vertical-spring-ticker` (STEPS = number of line advances)
- spring-overshoot marker pop → `spring-pop-entrance` (back.out spring) — also `gsap-effects` for the staggered pop chain
- check / icon draw-in inside marker → `svg-path-draw`
- live line-art icon in a tile (internal parts) → `svg-icon-enrichment`
- pill / label mask-wipe text reveal → `techniques.md` (clip-path reveal)
- dim-by-position de-emphasis → `gsap-effects` (per-line opacity by slot position; no dedicated rule)
- line-by-line headline fill → `discrete-text-sequence`
- accent-gradient proof number count-up → `counting-dynamic-scale`
- gentle parallax / sine float on hold → `sine-wave-loop` (apply the concurrent-elements amplitude `/√N` rule for a held grid)
- slow camera push-in → `multi-phase-camera` (steady-push phase pattern)
- center-card scale-up + forward overlap → `spring-pop-entrance` (the quick spring) + `techniques.md` CSS-3D (z-depth overlap)
- cards-grow-from-behind-icons / icon-shrink-to-header → driven by the camera reveal (`multi-phase-camera`) — the grow/shrink are scale tweens chorded to the pull-back phase; no separate rule
- fixed HUD / viewfinder brackets → `ai-tracking-box` (static-bracket variant — overlay frame, not tracking)
- book-end headline fade → `discrete-text-sequence` (or `gsap-effects` fade)
- perpetual decorative orbit / disc / loop → `sine-wave-loop` (or `orbit-3d-entry` if it's an orbiting badge ring)
- traveling-glow sweep across/behind tiles → `ambient-glow-bloom` (one-pass traveling glow sweep across the tiles)
- motion-blur slide-out sweep (glass-card exit) → `motion-blur-streak` (directional velocity blur on the fast sweep that carries the cards off-frame)
- grid slide-up fly-out exit → `gsap-effects` (plain staggered translate-off-frame; no dedicated rule needed — a basic exit tween, not a missing capability)
- skeleton-pill progress fill → `stat-bars-and-fills` (progress-fill `scaleX` form; the leading tip is a chorded child element)
- fill-completes-swap-to-real-data / live status-pill flips / headline crossfade between waves → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-state replacement at time thresholds — the pill's states are text states)
- staggered top-to-bottom fill cascade → `gsap-effects` (per-row stagger on the fill tweens)
- tethered-card spring-in → `spring-pop-entrance` (the card) + `avatar-cloud-network` (the thin connection-line-to-anchor layout; anchor coordinates must match the marker exactly) + `svg-path-draw` if the tether draws in
- pulsing marker rings → `cursor-click-ripple` (its expanding-ring + attack-decay opacity envelope, minus the cursor/click, on a bounded repeat)
- sticky-column internal horizontal scroll → `viewport-change` (PAN form on the inner column layer; the sticky column sits outside the panned layer) — mark the moving layer `data-layout-allow-overflow` and clip at the table card
- rapid vertical stream past a focal slot + deceleration stop → `vertical-spring-ticker` (continuous form: one long decelerating translate instead of its stepped tweens; focal-slot emphasis reuses the dim-by-position mapping above)
- pill-widens-as-label-fills → `card-morph-anchor`'s substitution law (uniform `scaleX`/clip-path — never tween `width`) + `discrete-text-sequence` for the label fill
- push-through-the-hero-item exit → `multi-phase-camera` (single accelerating push phase) aimed via `coordinate-target-zoom` at the highlighted chip, crossfading at peak
- receding word-grid depth field → `viewport-change` (one `.world` wrapper, `cam.scale` ↓ continuously — the zoom-OUT reveal grammar pointed at a word field; size/opacity tiers fake the depth)
- price snap-build (split-second partial state) → `discrete-text-sequence` (non-linear typing with bulk additions — exactly its typo/partial-state mechanic)
- left-to-right URL reveal → `techniques.md` (clip-path reveal — same mapping as the pill mask-wipe); the final-beat color flip → `gsap-effects` (a `tl.set` at the beat — basic, no rule needed)

**camera modifier — zoom-OUT reveal** (optional; the role-defining move for the glass-card and logo-wall variants): a camera wrapper around the whole array scales DOWN over the hold, revealing the assembled grid/cards sitting inside a larger environment (ecosystem scale, or a row of cards unfolding from tight icons).

- Continuous single-pass zoom-out (Social_Proof ecosystem pull-back) → `viewport-change` (one wrapper, `cam.scale` ↓ via onUpdate — single source of truth)
- Phased pull-back → focus → settle, with built-in drift (Key_Feature tight-icons → cards-unfold) → `multi-phase-camera` (use the "Dramatic reveal: push → neutral → pull" / pull-back phase pattern; grow/shrink of cards chords to the pull-back phase)

---

```
BLUEPRINT: grid-card-assemble — serves Key_Feature, Benefits, Social_Proof (folded 4 drafts + 2 mined clusters: live-data-populate-board, item-field-to-payoff-card)
RULE COVERAGE: complete, no gaps — traveling-glow sweep → ambient-glow-bloom; motion-blur slide-out sweep (exit) → motion-blur-streak; grid slide-up fly-out (exit) → gsap-effects (plain translate); skeleton-fill populate → stat-bars-and-fills + discrete-text-sequence; push-through-hero exit → multi-phase-camera + coordinate-target-zoom
```

Merge tension: `center-outward-expansion` (the natural backing for stagger-assemble) caps cleanly at 3–8 items and explicitly warns 8+ causes mid-flight overlap chaos — but a Social_Proof logo wall is deliberately dense (12+ tiles), so for that variant the items must NOT burst from a shared center; they slide a short distance directly into their own slot (the rule's "starting partially-spread"/short-path form, or a `gsap-effects` per-item stagger), which the consolidated Scene-1 verb already specifies as "short distance directly into its slot."

# Ambient Glow Bloom

A soft radial glow that **blooms in behind a hero element** (card, logo, metric) and holds, giving it presence. Unlike `press-release-spring`'s click-triggered burst or `asr-keyword-glow`'s word-timed envelope, this glow is **un-triggered** — it blooms on the hero's settle and stays lit. Two forms: a **hero bloom** that swells behind a settling element then breathes, and a **traveling sweep** that translates a soft highlight across a surface exactly once.

## How It Works

A radial-gradient layer sits **behind** the hero (glow `z-index: 1`, hero `z-index: 2` — a glow in front occludes it), starting at `opacity: 0`. Over the bloom-in window it ramps `opacity: 0 → peak` with a gentle `scale` swell, timed so `BLOOM_START + BLOOM_DUR` lands on the hero's settle — glow and hero resolve as ONE beat ("powering on"), never glow-then-card. After bloom-in:

1. **Hero bloom** — a **bounded idle breathe** during the hold: a finite `ease: "none"` tween advances a `phase` proxy and `onUpdate` nudges opacity + scale a hair around peak (never a `yoyo` loop). `sin(0) = 0` → the breathe starts exactly at the bloom's resting state.
2. **Traveling sweep** — a narrow highlight band at one edge translates **once** across to the other (`x` off-surface to off-surface), clipped to the surface (`overflow: hidden`). One pass, no return — a repeating sweep reads as a loading shimmer, not a reveal accent (the shimmer-sweep variation below is the sanctioned exception).

Peak opacity stays restrained (**≤ 0.45 hard ceiling**) so the glow gives presence without washing the frame; the glow color is **darker + more saturated** than the element it backs (a same-hue, same-lightness glow disappears into the surface).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<div class="bloom-stage">
  <div class="bloom-glow" id="bloom-glow"></div>
  <!-- z-index: 1; inset: GLOW_INSET (negative); background: {glowGradient} -->
  <div class="hero-card" id="hero-card">{HeroLabel}</div>
  <!-- z-index: 2 -->
</div>
<!-- sweep form: <div class="sweep" id="sweep"> inside the overflow:hidden surface -->
```

```js
// ── Form A: HERO BLOOM ── bloom in soft, landing on the hero's settle.
tl.fromTo(
  "#bloom-glow",
  { opacity: 0, scale: GLOW_START_SCALE },
  { opacity: GLOW_PEAK_OPACITY, scale: 1, duration: BLOOM_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  BLOOM_START,
);
// Bounded breathe during the hold — finite phase tween, NOT a yoyo loop.
const glow = document.getElementById("bloom-glow");
const phase = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  phase,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BREATHE_CYCLES,
    duration: BREATHE_DUR,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const s = Math.sin(phase.p);
      glow.style.opacity = String(GLOW_PEAK_OPACITY + s * OPACITY_AMP);
      glow.style.transform = `scale(${1 + s * SCALE_AMP})`;
    },
  },
  BLOOM_START + BLOOM_DUR,
);

// ── Form B: TRAVELING SWEEP ── one finite pass, constant glide.
tl.fromTo(
  "#sweep",
  { x: SWEEP_START_X, opacity: 0 },
  { x: SWEEP_END_X, opacity: SWEEP_PEAK_OPACITY, duration: SWEEP_DUR, ease: "none" },
  SWEEP_START,
);
tl.to("#sweep", { opacity: 0, duration: SWEEP_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.in" }, SWEEP_FADE_START);
```

## Variations

- **Bloom-and-hold** — for scenes <3s or a hero with its own idle, skip the breathe: the single `fromTo` is the whole recipe.
- **Pulse-on-arrival** — bloom slightly PAST peak (`GLOW_OVERSHOOT_OPACITY`, `scale: 1.06`), then a second adjacent tween eases down to a steady hold — one breath punctuating the landing, no ongoing loop.
- **Multi-hero relay** — stagger per-glow `BLOOM_START` by ~0.15–0.3s across a row; shrink `OPACITY_AMP` / `SCALE_AMP` per the `/√N` rule below.
- **Diagonal raked sweep** — angle `{sweepGradient}` (~105°) across a wordmark: the classic one-pass logo sheen. Narrower `SWEEP_WIDTH`, higher `SWEEP_PEAK_OPACITY`.

### Shimmer sweep (text-clipped status-phrase working-state)

The sweep re-aimed **inside type**: a soft highlight gradient clipped into a status phrase ("Thinking…", "Analyzing dataset…") via `background-clip: text` travels left→right through the letterforms — the grey-on-grey shimmer that says _still working_. Unlike every other form here it legitimately **repeats while the status is live**: the repetition is diegetic working-state, not idle wobble (same defense as a blinking caret — the motion performs status). Two things keep it honest: it is **bounded** (one finite tween whose pass count is computed from the status window, never `repeat: -1`), and it is **killed at resolve** — the moment the status completes, the shimmer stops dead; a shimmer surviving into the answer beat turns a working indicator into decoration.

```js
// Status shimmer — N passes as ONE bounded tween. Killed at resolve.
const status = document.getElementById("status-phrase");
// CSS on #status-phrase: background: {shimmerGradient}; background-size: 300% 100%;
// -webkit-background-clip: text; background-clip: text; color: transparent;
const shimmer = { p: 0 };
const PASSES = Math.round(STATUS_DUR / PASS_PERIOD); // whole passes, computed up front
tl.to(
  shimmer,
  {
    p: PASSES,
    duration: STATUS_DUR,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const t = shimmer.p % 1; // 0→1 within each pass; percent axis inverted → left→right travel
      status.style.backgroundPosition = `${(1 - t) * 100}% 50%`;
    },
  },
  STATUS_START,
);
tl.set(status, { backgroundPosition: "100% 50%" }, STATUS_START + STATUS_DUR); // resolve: dead.
```

Keep it a whisper: `{shimmerGradient}` is the status text's own grey with one slightly-lighter band (highlight stop a step above the base, nothing near white); `background-size` ~300% keeps the band narrow in the glyphs; `PASS_PERIOD` 1.2–1.8s — slower reads as a sheen accent, faster as a spinner. Whole-number `PASSES` lands the band at its start position exactly at the kill frame, so the `tl.set` is visually a no-op. This is the working-state cousin of `gradient-text-sweep`: reach **here** when the sweep _means_ "in progress," **there** when the gradient is the typographic treatment itself.

## Critical Constraints

- **Glow peak opacity ≤ 0.45** — including breathe amplitude; default to the LOW end (0.15–0.30).
- **Glow behind, hero in front**; glow color darker + more saturated than the hero surface.
- **Land glow and hero as one beat** — before or after reads as two separate events.
- **Breathe is bounded, sweep is one pass** — the only sanctioned repetition is the shimmer sweep, bounded and killed at resolve.
- **Concurrent halos compound** — per-glow amps ≤ default `/√N`, stagger breathe periods (2.6s / 2.9s / 3.3s) so they don't pulse in lockstep.
- **Don't combine a `boxShadow` glow on the hero with this halo layer** — they compete and read muddy; the glow lives on the dedicated layer.
